# Admin-Dashboard

The Odin Project – Intermediate HTML and CSS – [Admin Dashboard](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard)

The goal of this project is to build a full dashboard design leaning heavily on grid for the majority of the layout work.

- Grid for the layout
- Color Palletes from [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors)
- Icons are SVGs downloaded from [Material Design Icons](https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/)
